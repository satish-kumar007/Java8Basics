Abstract class vs interface with default methods
Point 1: However both contains concrete methods, still bot are not same.
Point 2: Abstract class contains constructor but interface with default does not.
Point 3: Inside interface all variable are public static final, we can declare instance variable
there, but in abstract class we can declare instance variables.
Point 4: In abstract class you can declare static and instance block but not in interface with default.
Point 5: Inside interface we can't override Object class method but, in abstract class we can.
Point 6: Functional interface refer to lambda expression but abstract classes not.
